The input plugins determine the source of the list. Files are processed
atomically and the input plugins provide this atomic action.

You can configure more than one input plugin, if you wanted
to input the content from more than one place.

Input plugins are loaded as named entry points.

.. warning::
    Blocking input plugins will prevent others from being run. They are run
    sequentially. For example, with the :ref:`file_system<File System Input>` plugin, you could configure
    several to scan multiple directories.
